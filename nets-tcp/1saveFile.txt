BEGINTheory is relevant to practice. It provides conceptual tools that practitioners use in computer engineering. Designing a new programming language for a specialized application? What you learned about grammars in this course comes in handy. Dealing with string searching and pattern matching? Remember ?nite automata and regular expressions. Confronted with a problem that seems to require more computer time than you can afford? Think back to what you learned about NP-completeness. Various application areas, such as modern cryptographic protocols, rely on theoretical principles that you will learn here. Theory also is relevant to you because it shows you a new, simpler, and more elegant side of computers, which we normally consider to be complicated machines. The best computer designs and applicationsare conceived with elegance in mind. A theoretical course can heighten your aesthetic sense and help you build more beautiful systems.
